Requirements and Troubleshooting Guide

Requirements:
PowerShell Script (fetch_and_ping.ps1)

    Plink: A command-line interface to PuTTY. Ensure plink.exe is downloaded and available on your system. Download Plink
        Path: Update $plinkPath in the PowerShell script with the location of plink.exe.

    Python: Python must be installed on your system. Download Python
        Ensure python command is available in your PATH.

    Python Script (ping_script.py):
        The Python script requires the ping3 library. Install it using:

        bash

        pip install ping3

    Cisco Device Access:
        Ensure you have the correct SSH credentials and network access to the Cisco device.

Setup Instructions
1. Prepare Your Environment

    Download Plink and place it in a directory accessible from your PATH or specify its full path in the PowerShell script.
    Install Python and ensure it is added to your system’s PATH.
    Install the ping3 library using pip.

2. Configure Scripts

    PowerShell Script:
        Update $plinkPath to the path of plink.exe.
        Set $hostname, $username, and $password with your Cisco device’s details.
        Update $pythonScriptPath to the path where ping_script.py is saved.

    Python Script:
        Ensure the ARP table output format matches the regex in ping_script.py. Modify if necessary.

3. Run the PowerShell Script

    Open PowerShell and navigate to the directory containing fetch_and_ping.ps1.
    Execute the script:

    powershell

    .\fetch_and_ping.ps1

Basic Troubleshooting
PowerShell Script Issues

    Error: "Failed to create ARP table file."
        Check: Ensure plink.exe is correctly specified and accessible.
        Verify: Ensure network connectivity and correct SSH credentials for the Cisco device.
        Log: Check the output of the plink command manually to ensure it’s working correctly.

    Error: PowerShell can't find the Python executable
        Check: Ensure Python is installed and added to the system PATH.
        Verify: You can run python --version in a PowerShell window to check if Python is recognized.

Python Script Issues

    Error: Missing ping3 library
        Check: Ensure you’ve installed the ping3 library using pip.
        Verify: You can test the installation by running pip show ping3 in a terminal.

    Error: IP addresses not being parsed correctly
        Check: Verify the format of the ARP table output matches the regular expression in ping_script.py.
        Modify: Adjust the regex in parse_arp_table function if needed.

General Troubleshooting

    Check File Paths: Ensure all paths (for plink.exe, PowerShell script, Python script) are correctly specified.
    Permissions: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute scripts and access network resources.
    Logs: Review script outputs and error messages for specific issues.
